# MKJWKS Development Transcript

This transcript documents the complete development process of the MKJWKS (Make JSON Web Key Set) system, built entirely by GitHub Copilot.

## Initial Request
**User:** can you use jose cli to create a jwks json file for me, please ask any questsion to establish algorithm etc

**Assistant:** To create a JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) file using the jose CLI, I need a few details:

1. Which key algorithm do you want to use? (e.g., RS256, ES256, EdDSA, etc.)
2. How many keys do you want in the JWKS?
3. Should the keys be for signing, encryption, or both?
4. Do you want the private keys included, or just the public keys?
5. Any specific key parameters (e.g., key size for RSA, curve for EC)?

## Algorithm Selection and Initial Setup

**User:** both for signing, i intend for one to be the roll over key (is that the correct usage?)
can we get 2 files, one with just public, and one with both
what crypto algorithim do you recommend for good interoperability and security

**Assistant:** Yes, your usage is correct: having two keys in the JWKS allows for key rollover—one active, one for future use.

For interoperability and security, RS256 (RSA 2048-bit, using SHA-256) is widely supported and secure. It's the default for many OAuth2/OIDC providers and libraries.

Here's the plan:
1. Generate two RSA key pairs (2048 bits, RS256).
2. Create a JWKS file with both public and private keys.
3. Create a JWKS file with only the public keys.

I'll proceed to generate the jose CLI commands and files for you.

*[Copilot then checked for jose CLI availability and generated the keys using commands like:]*
- `jose jwk gen -i '{"alg":"RS256","use":"sig"}' -s 2048 > rsa1.json`
- Combined keys using `jq` to create proper JWKS format

## GitHub Actions Automation

**User:** thanks, can you create github action to run the roll key script every 48 hours and auto commit

**Assistant:** *[Created `.github/workflows/roll-jwks-key.yml` with:]*
- Schedule: `cron: '0 */48 * * *'`
- Auto-commit functionality
- Jose CLI installation
- Git configuration for automated commits

## Security and Git Management

**User:** thanks, and for the rsa1* and rsa2* as those are working files i guess
can you update readme as well for the repo

**Assistant:** *[Updated `.gitignore` to exclude private keys and created comprehensive README.md documentation]*

## Project Restructuring

**User:** can we use a temp directory to do the intermediate operations and list that in gitignore, and also move the sh files to a script directory - the generated jwks can stay at the root

**Assistant:** *[Restructured project with:]*
- Created `scripts/` directory
- Moved shell scripts to `scripts/`
- Used `scripts/tmp/` for intermediate files
- Updated paths and created wrapper scripts for backward compatibility
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `scripts/tmp/`

## Script Parameterization

**User:** thanks can you number 8 with defaults to what we already have

*[Reference to earlier suggestion about parameterization]*

**Assistant:** *[Updated `generate_jwks.sh` to accept parameters:]*
- Number of keys (default 2)
- Algorithm (default RS256)  
- Key size (default 2048)

**User:** we will need the same for roll over, and update the readme

**Assistant:** *[Updated `roll_jwks_key.sh` with similar parameterization and comprehensive README updates]*

## GitHub Actions Compatibility

**User:** the workflow action will not work becuase the tmp keys are not persisted between runs, can you use the jwks_public instead?

**Assistant:** You're absolutely right! The tmp files won't persist between GitHub Actions runs. I'll update the workflow to check for the JWKS files instead.

*[Updated workflow to check for `jwks_public.json` existence instead of temp files]*

**User:** thanks, the roll script will need updating too, ideally it should not copy/read from the old rsa1.json or rsa2.json files as they are not persisted - instead it can get the public key from the jwks_public.json - and only store the private keyset of the new key

**Assistant:** *[Major update to roll script:]*
- Read existing key from `jwks_public.json` using `jq '.keys[0]'`
- Generate only new private key
- Combine new private key with old public key
- No longer depend on persisted temp files

## JWKS Format Correction

**User:** is the format for the jwks_private correct?

**Assistant:** Looking at the `jwks_private.json` structure from the test, it's not correct. The current format has an extra nested `keys` array...

*[Fixed JWKS format issues by correcting `jose jwk gen` output parsing and `jq` commands]*

## Key Identification (kid) Implementation

**User:** lets include the k in the key - can we use the creation timestamp for that?

**Assistant:** Great idea! Adding a `kid` (Key ID) with creation timestamp will make key identification and rotation tracking much easier.

*[Updated both scripts to include `kid` with Unix timestamps, format: `key-1-{timestamp}`]*

**User:** is this unix timestamp?

**Assistant:** Yes, that's a Unix timestamp! The `date +%s` command generates Unix timestamps (seconds since January 1, 1970 UTC).

**User:** yes can you just use the iso date it and can omit the key-1 prefix

**Assistant:** *[Updated to use clean ISO 8601 timestamps:]*
- Format: `2025-06-14T05:29:40Z`
- Using `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`
- No prefixes, just clean timestamps

## Final Documentation

**User:** that figlet is too cool, can we have more plain

**Assistant:** *[Updated ASCII art to simpler format and added prominent GitHub Copilot credit]*

**User:** can you put at the top of readme that this was all done by github copilot and use some cool figet font for the title

**Assistant:** *[Added ASCII art header and GitHub Copilot attribution]*

## Final System Summary

The completed MKJWKS system includes:

### Core Components:
- **`scripts/generate_jwks.sh`**: Parameterized key generation
- **`scripts/roll_jwks_key.sh`**: Smart key rollover with persistence
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated 48-hour key rotation
- **Security**: Private keys excluded from git, temp directory management

### Key Features:
- **RS256 Algorithm**: 2048-bit RSA keys for maximum compatibility
- **ISO 8601 Key IDs**: Clean timestamp-based identification
- **Persistence**: Works across GitHub Actions runs via `jwks_public.json`
- **Parameterization**: Configurable algorithms, key sizes, and counts
- **Automation**: Complete CI/CD integration with auto-commits

### File Structure:

### Security Model:
- Public keys tracked in git for distribution
- Private keys never committed
- Temporary files isolated and ignored
- Automated key rotation for security

This system demonstrates a complete DevOps solution for JWKS management, built entirely through AI-assisted development with GitHub Copilot.
